                Howdy! My name’s Jameson - a curious mind learning full stack web development. I have experience in
                mobile apps, oil & gas IoT sensors, and software sales.<br><br>

                In 2015, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Economics & Business. While
                in school, I started a software company called Flexter Inc., developing mobile applications for fitness
                influencers. <br><br>

                My responsibilities included design, product and project management of the entire development cycle from
                inception to launch. I contracted developers overseas in Russia and Bulgaria to build the app. I’d then
                license the use of this code to trainers in a profit share agreement. My company was accepted into Capital Factory’s Accelerator program and has since generated over $300k+
                in sales. <br><br>

                In my spare time - I love to find and share great music on SoundCloud, experience the great outdoors,
                play golf, hang out with my fiends, and learn to code. <br><br>
